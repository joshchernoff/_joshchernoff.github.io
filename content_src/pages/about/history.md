The Autistic Community Activity Program began in 1987 as a grassroots effort by parents and supportive professionals seeking to fill an unmet need. Parents were searching for a summer activities program and day camp for their children with autism. They found none, so got together and built one.

ACAP's ability to adapt and adjust our program throughout our 35 year history is one reason for its longevity. In 2012, in recognition of lack of summer activities and services for those over 18, our name changed from the Autistic Children Activity Program to the Autistic Community Activity Program. ACAP was also grandfathered into the state of Oregon's expanded Medicaid Agency Certification. Our work with DHS as a Certified Medicaid Agency has expanded to include endorsements with Community Living Supports, Employment Services, and Behavioral Services.

Through new and growing partnership and initiatives with Community Workshop and ARRO, ACAP is building an expanded community center to support clients with autism and their families. By combining our skills and expertise, we are increasingly able to foster our clients' skills and interests leading to their increased career and community engagement opportunities and successes.
