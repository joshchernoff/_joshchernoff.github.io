The Autistic Community Activity Program (ACAP) has served people with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) since 1987, providing a quality eight week-long day camp program which combines daily community activities with a familiar schedule and structure. Our summer camp program provides structure in a variety of onsite and community settings while teaching vital and much neglected skills. Campers make positive strides in learning and practicing practical life-skills, relationship development, social and communication skills, public transportation travel, appropriate community behaviors, and reading environmental cues.
