The year-round PROJECTS Program grew from ACAP's previous, summer-camp-only, Mentor Program. Collaborating with our partner organization, Community Workshop, young adults research and explore activities and ideas they are most passionate about. With one-to-one guidance, they then develop long-term projects as well as participate in community activities, all focused on continued development of creative, social, and professional skills. Most PROJECTS clients aren't at ACAP fulltime, so we begin by creating an individualized schedule that accommodates their ACAP, personal, and career activities. In group and individual meetings, everyone shares their goals so that we can strategize how to achieve them both on our own as well as through sharing ideas and skills. We learn and grow through our research, our hands-on work, and from each other.

In addition to our creative projects like beading, sculpting, graphic design, and weaving, Community Workshop offers their expertise including in metal and wood working, 3D printing, laser cutting, and virtual reality. Together, this is diverse foundation for realizing projects and developing a deeper understanding of who we are and our place in the world. We also have regular Friday Night Dinners. Clients and staff plan meals, grocery shop, and cook together, developing healthy eating habits and building socializing skills.
