      <h2>Looking for a fun and interesting job?:</h2>
      <p>The Autistic Community Activity Program (ACAP) has served people with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) for 35
        years. We offer a quality eight week long summer day camp for individuals aged 7 years and older that provides
        structure in a variety of on-site and community settings. Our 1:1 camper-to-staff ratio supports our campers
        through teaching and practicing vital, but much-neglected skills including: relationship development, social and
        communication skills, public transportation travel, and appropriate community behaviors. While following CDC and
        DHS mandated Covid-19 guidelines, daily activities might include yoga, swimming, visits to parks, OMSI or
        bowling, trips for ice cream or other treats, and arts and crafts.</p>


      <p>Even if you aren't available every day, you should still apply! We work hard to have a flexible summer
        schedule to accommodate a diverse staff with a variety of skills and experiences.</p>
